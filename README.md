This repositories contains several scripts used for my MS Degree in Computer Engineering. Among them you can find:
* **shannon_entropy.sh**: a bash script to compute the Shannon's entropy of a single file;
* **python scripts for VirusTotal**: scripts to upload malwares to VirusTotal and get back results 
* **script for malware downloading**: script for downloading malware from the MalwareBazaar website, selecting them by file_type (e.g. ELF)
* **script for deleting downloaded malwares that are not compiled for x86 architectures**

> WARNING: this repo will include also a set of downloaded malwares in ELF format. Please use them only for research and study purposes
